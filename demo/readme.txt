This is the demo folder of the paper 
"PIANOTREE VAE: STRUCTURED REPRESENTATION LEARNING FOR POLYPHONIC MUSIC"
Submitted to ISMIR2020.

* The folder `latent_space_interpolation` corresponds to Section 4.6 of the paper.
    * We provide 5 samples of latent space interpolation in separate folders.
    * Each folder contains 5 versions of interpolation by different methods.
    * The starting and ending bars are slightly different because of reconstruction error of different models.

* The folder `downstream_generation` corresponds to Section 4.7 of the paper.
    * We provide 6 samples for both 8-bar generation and 16-bar generation in separate folders.
    * Each folder contains 3 versions of generation by different methods.
    * Note that the first 4 bars are given in all samples.
